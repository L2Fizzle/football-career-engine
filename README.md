# football-career-engine
## About
  - A Python-based football career simulator that models match performance, player progression, transfers, performance, and season outcomes through a stat-driven simulator.

## Features
  - Simulated individual match performance based on opponent strength
  - Probability-driven outcomes for shot attempts, key passes, and dribble attempts
  - Dynamic skill progression system (shooting, passing, dribbling, and more in the future)
  - Team stat data derived from real-world performance

## How it works (Currently)
Match outcomes are determined through weighted probability calculations
Influenced by:
  - Player attributes
  - Opponent defensive level
  - In-game event attempts

Performance affects the amount of skill points granted, which alters future probability calculations

## Future Improvements
  - Full Premier League integration
  - Multi-season simulation
  - Club transfers
  - Expanded stat tracking
